			Creating a Webpage on the Production Server
		</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			<h3>
				Step by Step
			</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
					After cloning your repository and accessing it through terminal, create two new gedit files named "index.html" and "main.css"
					</li>
					<li>
					Edit your webpage using HTML code for index, then link it with main.css and use CSS to customize the look of your website.
					</li>
					<li>
					Save your files, and use the git commands to save it on GitHub for safety.
					</li>
					<li>
					In terminal, access the production server using "sftp [name-id]@cmis-hsteacher". Add the production server to your known servers if it's the first time accessing it, and enter your password. Be sure to have moved to the location of your file before accessing the servers
					</li>
					<li>
					Once in the production server, move into the "public_html" folder.
					</li>
					<li>
					You can add files using "put [file name]" and remove them using "rm [file name]".
					</li>
					<li>
					Whilst having your terminal out with the production server accessed, you can view your work by opening a browser and typing "cmis-hsteacher/~[name-id]" in the address bar.
					</li>
