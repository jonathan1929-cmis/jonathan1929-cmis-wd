  - Open the terminal
       + The terminal is a black icon with a white border containing the symbols ">_" in it.
       + It should be located by default at the bottom left corner of your screen on the application's taskbar.
       + If by some black magic it isn't, simply click the menu button and type "Terminal" in the search bar.
       + Hit enter or click on the terminal that shows up
  - Once the terminal is open, enter in this command:


        git clone --config="http.proxy=http://your-network-username:your-network-password@192.168.2.1:8080" https://github.com/your-github-username/your-github-repository-name.git


  - Note:
       + The generic CTRL+C CTRL+V will not work in terminal.
       + Instead, press Shift+Insert to paste.
  - Replace placeholders with your appropriate information.
       + your network username
       + your network password
       + your github username
       + your github repository name.git
  - If this text appears, that means it worked:

              Cloning into '[Your repository name]'...
              remote: Counting objects: 37, done.
              remote: Compressing objects: 100% (33/33), done.
              remote: Total 37 (delta 12), reused 12 (delta 3), pack-reused 0
              Unpacking objects: 100% (37/37), done.

  - Once cloning your repository file, type in "cd [your repository name] to move the terminal into your repository folder.
       + The command line should now contain "[Hardware name] ~/[your repository name] $"
  - Now that you have moved the terminal into your folder, create a new file.
       + To perform this task, type "gedit [File Name]"
       + Your new file should open up in gedit.
  - Edit the file to your liking, then save it. (CTRL+S, File -> Save)
  - Once done, go back to your terminal.
  - Type in "git add [your file name that you just edited]
